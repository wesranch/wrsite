    "text": "I am a second-year masters student at the University of Oregon working at the intersection of climate change, forest ecology, and spatial data science. I’m a part of the Terrestrial Ecosystems and Ecological Landscapes Lab (TEEL), and am working under the direction of Dr. Melissa Lucash.\nMy background is in hydrology and forest ecology, and I have experience using tools like ArcGIS, Google Earth Engine, Python, and R to answer questions about how ecosystems are changing. For example, my masters thesis is focused on mapping and modeling above-ground carbon density in interior Alaska using Landsat imagery, random forests, and a forest simulation model: LANDIS-II.\nA brief overview of what you will find on this site: my code page provides a glimpse of how I apply my GIS and programming skills to meet research objectives. My teaching page showcases labs I have developed which teach students how to apply key concepts in remote sensing. Lastly, some maps and posters I have made can be found on the portfolio page.\n\n\nM.S. in Geography University of Oregon | Eugene, OR (In progress)\nB.A. in Environmental Studies, Geography, and Philosophy Ohio Wesleyan University | Delaware, OH"
